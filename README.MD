This repository is being created to document the efforts of the Tampa Hacker Space (THS) group
to create a simple 16 bit computer from discrete logic. It is heavily influenced/ derived
from the design of Ben Eater (https://www.youtube.com/user/eaterbc). The information 
contained within this repository is not a result of my creation, but rather my documentation 
of the THS Homebrew Computer groups efforts.
